# DWS_Neutralizer
Reverts all changes made to Windows 10 (including disabled Cortana), caused by "Destroy Windows Spying" Tool [DWS_Lite.exe] to default state.

Note: It doesn't reinstall removed metro apps!

Disclaimer: This method is 100% working and tested on my own machine. However, there's a chance that I didn't mentioned all the changes, and maybe I missed some registry keys. Please be warned that it reverts affected settings to Out-of-Box state, so if you changed some of those, you may need to re-enable/configure them. !Do it at your ownrisk!
